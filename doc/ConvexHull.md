# Convex Hull 算法

## What is a Convex Hull

A Convex object is one with no interior angles greater than 180 degrees. A shape that is not convex is called Non-Convex or Concave. An example of a convex and a non-convex shape is shown below.Hull means the exterior or the shape of the object.

Therefore, the Convex Hull of a shape or a group of points is a tight fitting convex boundary around the points or the shape. The Convex Hull of a convex object is simply its boundary. The Convex Hull of a concave shape is a convex boundary that most tightly encloses it.
